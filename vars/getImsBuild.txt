# getImsBuild

## Overview

When you invoke the `getImsBuild` step, it will read the parameters set within an 
upstream job (either `WRAPPER` or `DISTRIBUTABLES`). This provides a mechanism to retrieve the
latest available build information from an upstream build process.

## Usage

```
library identifier: 'jenkins_shared_libraries'

getImsBuild upstreamTrigger: "DISTRIBUTABLE"
```

```
-> call(input)
reads variables from the jenkinsfile and passes to the Library
```

```
-> getImsBuild()
By default, will find the nearest "WRAPPER" and retrieve parameters of the last successful build
```

```
-> getImsBuild(upstreamTrigger)
By default, will find the nearest user-specified job and retrieve parameters of the last successful build
```
