<p>When you invoke this "sendmail" shared library it will read the values from
the pipeline script. The build metadata info is read for the current build.
Depending on the status of the build and email notification send out to the
MAILLIST recipient list and to the committers of the build.
The changelists displayed in the email notifications are cummulative changes
since the last successful build.
</p>

<p>Following is the way to call library from jenkinsfile</p>

<p>@Library('jenkins_shared_libraries') _ //if you change library name in default configs change it here as well</p>
<p>sendmail{</p>
<p>    ** REQUIRED **                    
<p>    Genre = "USM"</p>
<p>    Branch = "6_3_0-STAGING"</p>
<p>    Maillist = "um-blr-dev@cisco.com"</p>
<p>    Ichnaea = "123456" </p> 
<p>    Version = "6.3.0"</p>

<p>}</p>

<p>
NOTE : Genre, Branch, Maillist, Ichnaea, Version  are the required variables and 
       these are mappend to build.gen, build.brn, build.rec, build.ich, build.ver
       in the shared Library

<p>
-> call(emailNotify)
Reads variables from the jenkinsfile and passes to the Library
</p>

<p>
-> sendNotification(bld)
Read the bld variable that has all the metadata information of current build job.
Depending on the outcome of the build, subject of the notification is created.
Along with all needed information of the build, changelists, console output (for failed builds),
the email notification is sent to MAILLIST defined for the branch and committers of the build.
The changes includes all changelists since the last succesful build.
